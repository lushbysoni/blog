*“ if the children are our future then there’s no greater way to invest in the future then investing in our children”&nbsp;*Dr. Nivradha Singh.&nbsp;

Here you are new parent you set eyes on their tiny little face and they let out that coo, ah they are perfect. And within a blink of an eye you are presented with a hefty medical bill or fee structure and you were not prepared. Now what??&nbsp;

Here are some ways to protect your little ones whether you have them right now or not. Before you are met with a tear jerking bill or situation that could have easily been avoided.&nbsp;

**1\.Get a health cover.**

Who wants to foot every health expense in cash? Those impromptu hospital visits will leave your wallet empty and even in debt if a serious health emergency occurs. If getting private insurance is out for the question look into a national health cover&nbsp;[http://www.nhif.or.ke/](http://www.nhif.or.ke/)&nbsp;and get covered. Also shop around for the best insurer don’t get a health cover just because, do some due diligence.

**2\. Purchase an education cover.**

With the rate of inflation school fees will soar up to the high heavens in several years.

**3\. Look into a permanent housing solution.**

The security of having your own home is immeasurable. Not only will you have that safety but your children will not have to suffer the indignity of being sheltered elsewhere in the event you hit a rough patch.

**5\.Create an investment fund for your child.**

You know those banks that give you a cute little piggy bank when you open an account for your child, the maximum yield is usually 5% p.a why don’t you buy shares/bonds with whatever money you wanted to put into that account and re invest the money back into your child’s future?&nbsp;[https://www.centralbank.go.ke/securities/treasury-bonds/](https://www.centralbank.go.ke/securities/treasury-bonds/)

**8\. Get life insurance.**

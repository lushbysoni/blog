<p>The â€œself careâ€ and â€œglow upâ€ movement has shifted a lot of peopleâ€™s mentality on skin care and wellness.</p>

<p>Â  Perhaps by now we have all heard monikers coined around the word hydrate, so we pretty much understand why water is essential for great skin. A healthy balanced diet that incorporates fruits and vegetables is also essential for healthy glowing skin.</p>

<p>Â  The next step to take in order to boost that glow is to add an exfoliant to your regimen. Those could be physical exfoliants that range from simple ones like loofahs, exfoliating gloves, beaded shower gels to the more complex microdermabrasion and many others.Â </p>

<p>Â On the other hand there are chemical exfoliating agents like lactic acid, AHA/BHA, glycolic acid, facial peels and the likes. But we mostly use those on our face and necks.Â </p>

<p>What about the rest of your body? You could be experiencing uneven skin tone due to sun exposure, â€˜backneâ€™ , scaring, postpartum hyperpigmentation or simply due to unknown reasons that have left your skin looking patchy. With a little exfoliation you could get rid of dead skin cells and therefore resulting into an even and brighter complexion.Â </p>
